# Cloud Status Dashboard

## Overview
The **Cloud Status Dashboard** is a lightweight React application that demonstrates foundational frontend development while integrating cloud awareness. It fetches and displays system/network status information from mock APIs, highlighting how frontend applications interact with cloud infrastructure.

This project bridges **cloud networking knowledge** and **basic React skills**, supporting a career focus in cloud engineering and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
